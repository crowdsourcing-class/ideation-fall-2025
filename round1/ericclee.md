# Crowdsourcing Project Idea: FoundryMatch

## Author

## Problem Statement
My project solves the problem of the difficulty in founding a startup team. The process of creating a startup involves creating a founding team and an idea that solves a critical problem that many people around the world face. 

## Core Concept
**One-line pitch:** 
A crowdsourced platform where users post real-world problems, vote on the most impactful ones, and form teams with others interested in solving them.

**Target users:**
Aspiring founders, engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs seeking collaborators or startup ideas.

**The crowd:**
Open internet users, primarily university students, startup enthusiasts, and early-stage professionals.

**The task:** 
Crowd members will: 
- Post and describe problems they face or observe.
- Upvote the most compelling problems.
- Join discussion threads or “problem hubs.”
- Form private teams or group chats around promising problems to brainstorm and prototype solutions collaboratively.

## Key Features
1. Problem Posting and Voting: Users can share challenges and collectively rank them by upvotes.
2. Team Formation System: Matching users based on shared interests, complementary skills, and time availability.
3. Discussion and Collaboration Hub: Real-time chat or forum for each problem, allowing ideation and coordination.
4. Progress Tracking: Simple tools for groups to document milestones and share progress publicly.

## Feasibility Check
**Data source:** 
User-generated content — problem submissions, votes, and discussions.

**Budget reality:**
Frontend and backend can be hosted using free tiers (e.g., Render, Firebase). AI-assisted matching and moderation can rely on free or low-cost APIs (< $500 total).

**Crowd size needed:** 
Initial pilot with 100–200 users to ensure meaningful voting and team formation.

**Quality control approach:** 
Weighted voting (by participation level), spam detection, and text content moderation through AI tools

## Technical Approach
**Human tasks:** 
Posting problems, voting, evaluating feasibility, and collaborating on solutions.

**Automated tasks:** 
Ranking posts, suggesting potential teammates based on shared interests or skill tags, and flagging duplicate or low-quality submissions.

**Aggregation method:** 
Use weighted upvotes and engagement metrics to surface the most valuable problems and active collaborations.

## Prior Work
**Similar projects:**
- Reddit r/Entrepreneur and IndieHackers (discussion-based but lack structured collaboration tools).
- Kickstarter (crowdfunds ideas but doesn’t crowdsource their creation).

**Lessons from past course projects:** 
From PixelPatchwork, I learned that sustained engagement requires iterative participation rather than one-off tasks.
From Memory Mosaic, I saw the importance of adding social features and structured collaboration rather than limiting crowd input to voting alone.

## Why This Could Work
FoundryMatch transforms problem-solving into a social, collaborative process. It’s technically feasible within course limits, promotes creativity and teamwork, and leverages crowdsourcing principles—aggregation, diversity, and iterative refinement—to help users co-create startup ideas and teams with real-world potential.
