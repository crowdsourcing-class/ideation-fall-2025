## Problem Statement
[In 2-3 sentences, describe the real-world problem your project will solve.]
With city events scattered across multiple platforms, it can be hard for residents to discover what's happening nearby (e.g. open mic nights, volunteer drives, etc). On the other side, many local or spontaneous events go unnoticed because there's a lack of a centralized, up-to-date platform that showcases these events. 

## Core Concept
**One-line pitch:** [What does your project do in one sentence?]
This project aims to crowdsource local residents' knowledge to build a live map of what events are happening around them.

**Target users:** [Who will benefit from this system?]
Not only the residents, but people who are visiting the city, small businesses advertising their events, and others who want to discover or promote nearby happenings.

**The crowd:** [Who are your workers? MTurk, volunteers, social media users?]
Mainly city residents, who have either heard of things going around them or are hosting, as well as volunteers / social media users, since they're in a better position to crawl through the Internet to find open postings.

**The task:** [What EXACTLY will crowd workers do? Be specific.]
Workers submit event posts, as well as verify / upvote nearby posts.

## Key Features
1. Interactive Map – shows the events in a user friendly way.
2. Posting Feature – quick workflow that will allow users to quickly upload events.
3. Verification System – (this might be harder) users must go through a verification system to verify their identity before they can post or see any postings.

## Feasibility Check
**Data source:** [Where will input data come from?]
User-generated event posts, can initially crawl through social media platforms to find postings from verified accounts.

**Budget reality:** [How can this work with < $500?]
Mainly would be spent on technical items, like hosting on databases / APIs. With $500, incentives wouldn't be as monetarily-based.

**Crowd size needed:** [Rough estimate: 10s, 100s, 1000s of workers?]
Initially 100s (assuming that maybe 1 in 10 would actually host something). Later, cities should have 1000s.

**Quality control approach:** [Initial idea for ensuring quality]
Upvotes, confirming events, can detect duplicate, setting event expiry.

## Technical Approach
**Human tasks:** [What parts require human intelligence?]
Adding events, confirming / upvoting events.

**Automated tasks:** [What parts will be computational?]
Putting on the map, deleting events after, detecting duplicates.

**Aggregation method:** [How will you combine crowd responses?]
Upvotes and flags to see what events are more popular and trustworthy.

## Prior Work
**Similar projects:** [Name 1-2 related projects and how yours differs]
Some projects at Penn have had this idea, but weren't made as far as I'm aware. Furthermore, Nextdoor events seem to focus more on neighborhoods.

**Lessons from past course projects:** [What did you learn from reviewing past projects?]
In general, this would need a strong incentive.

## Why This Could Work
[2-3 sentences on why this is viable within course constraints]
Most of the knowledge comes from people uploading events. Furthermore, this project (given there have been many times where I've heard this idea floating around), seems like it would have a relatively strong customer / user base.
