## Problem Statement
Across the world, we use satelites to track countless humanitarian tragedies from the burning of the Amazon, to the war in Gaza, to the genocide in Sudan. Currently, these issues are tracked by non-profits who suffer from limited manpower and resources. One Intelligence helps users contribute to raising awareness for these problems by open sourcing analysis of satelitle imagery.

## Core Concept
**One-line pitch:** You can contribute to awareness and understanding of causes that are important to you.

**Target users:** Causes that need support through awareness and analysis.

**The crowd:** Volunteers who care about a cause that matters to them such as conservation, humanitarianism etc.

**The task:** Workers will first select for what cause they want to analyze and include filters for exampele to ensure that no graphic images are shown. Then workers will analyze imagery to do things such as count how many buildings were destroyed in a Sudanese city or estimate deforestation in the Amazon.

## Key Features
1. Optionality to select causes that are important to you.
2. Ability to contribute your skillset of Analysis.
3. Impact visibility by updates from relevant non-profits.

## Feasibility Check
**Data source:** Satelite Imagery from Providers like Planet Labs under non-profit agreements like the ones they have with Amnesty International etc.

**Budget reality:** We are simply providing server hosting costs which we could also support with limited unobstrusive advertising or fundraising. Satelite imagery will be the biggest need but should be able to get it for free.

**Crowd size needed:** Each worker can make an impact but like need 100s to be able to cover all imagery.

**Quality control approach:** Mark accuracy by giving the same image to multiple users and comparing answers, or by having trusted users set the correct answer. We will rank users based on their accuracies which will help us ensure that we take into account the best information.

## Technical Approach
**Human tasks:** Analyzing complex images with a lot going on.

**Automated tasks:** Aggregating responses, providing users with a new image, performing quality control checks

**Aggregation method:** We will average responses using a weighted average based on the user's historical accuracy score. We will surface key words and numbers for each image and provide these to relevant non-profits.

## Prior Work
**Similar projects:** DataLabeler is the most similar because it involves users surfacing information about images. However, it is not the same because we have a stornger why, focusing on issues that truly matter to our users.

**Lessons from past course projects:** I learned a lot about implementation details as well as how each project has tradeoffs in terms of drives.

## Why This Could Work
I believe that this could be coded within the class and could have an impact. Furthermore, I believe that users would want to use this platform and contribute.
