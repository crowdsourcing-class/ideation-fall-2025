## Problem Statement
University campuses are often unaware of the true extent of sustainability practices and waste management challenges. While Penn is committed to sustainability, the real-time tracking of individual actions and community efforts is often lacking. The need for a crowd-powered system arises to track and improve sustainable practices across campus.

## Core Concept
**One-line pitch:** A crowdsourced platform for real-time tracking and verification of sustainability practices on the Penn campus.

**Target users:** Penn students, faculty, staff, and people who care about sustainability.

**The crowd:** Penn community members, including students and staff, who contribute by reporting on sustainability practices or by verifying actions.

**The task:** Crowd workers will report on sustainability activities (e.g., recycling, energy-saving actions, eco-friendly product use) and verify others' submissions to ensure data accuracy.

## Key Features
1. Real-time tracking of sustainability actions (recycling, energy-saving, etc.).
2. Community verification of reported sustainability efforts. 
3. Rewards and recognition for participants who make meaningful contributions to campus sustainability.

## Feasibility Check
**Data source:** Data will come from crowd-sourced reports submitted via a mobile or web app. This could include simple actions like recycling or attending sustainability events.

**Budget reality:** The main costs will be developing the platform and hosting servers. Given the scalability of the crowdsourcing model, initial development can be under $500 if the app uses existing platforms for authentication and data storage.

**Crowd size needed:** Around 100–500 students and staff for initial implementation.

**Quality control approach:** Reputation-based verification system where users earn points for accurate reporting and reviewing other submissions. This could be supplemented with moderation by sustainability professionals.

## Technical Approach
**Human tasks:** Verifying the actions reported by other users (e.g., checking if recycling stations are properly used, confirming energy-saving activities), as well as submitting their own sustainability practices.

**Automated tasks:** Aggregating and displaying the tracked data on a public leaderboard, which could help build a sense of community competition. Automated systems will also generate reports for sustainability tracking.

**Aggregation method:** Each sustainability action will be validated by a crowd of users who vote on whether the action was completed. The majority vote will confirm the submission as valid, and points will be awarded accordingly.

## Prior Work
**Similar projects:** "GreenPoints" at Cal State and "Recyclebank" in New York, both of which use crowdsourcing to track sustainability behaviors and reward participants. Our platform will be different by focusing specifically on Penn’s campus and integrating sustainability-focused academic projects.

**Lessons from past course projects:** I learned that platforms with both crowdsourced data submission and community verification are more successful in terms of accurate data. Additionally, having visible rewards and community engagement increases sustained participation.

## Why This Could Work
This project capitalizes on the existing student and staff interest in sustainability at Penn. The use of crowdsourcing ensures that the system can scale with minimal overhead, and the incentive structure will drive engagement. The app also offers direct benefits to users by allowing them to track their personal contributions to Penn’s sustainability efforts.
