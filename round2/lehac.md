_Replace [Project Title] with a creative name for your project_

## Authors

**Original Author:** [Name and PennKey of person whose idea this was]

**Contributor:** [Name and PennKey of partner who helped expand the idea]

## Problem Statement

[In 2-3 sentences, describe the problem your project will solve. What pain point or challenge are you addressing?]

## Target Audience

[Who will use this system? Who will be your crowd workers? Be specific about the types of users and workers involved.]

## Description

[Provide a clear description of your crowdsourcing project in 3-4 sentences. What will the system do? How will it work at a high level?]

## Project Type

_Select the category that best fits your project:_

- [ ] Human computation algorithm
- [ ] Social science experiment with the crowd
- [ ] Tool for crowdsourcing (requesters or workers)
- [ ] Business idea using crowdsourcing
- [ ] Other: [specify]

_List 5-8 key features or capabilities of your system. Expand from Round 1:_

1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]
4. [Feature 4]
5. [Feature 5]
6. [Feature 6 - optional]

## Feasibility: Crowd & Resources

**Where will your crowd workers come from?**
[E.g., MTurk, volunteers, social media users, students, etc.]

**What will they provide?**
[E.g., labels, votes, creative content, transcriptions, etc.]

**What skills do they need?**
[E.g., bilingual, domain expertise, basic internet skills, etc.]

**Do skills vary widely? How?**
[Explain if some workers will be better than others and why]

**How will you incentivize participation?**
[E.g., payment, gamification, intrinsic motivation, course credit. Be specific about your incentive design.]

**How much will it cost?**
[Provide rough cost estimates: $/task, $/worker, total budget needed]

**Where will your data come from?**
[E.g., public datasets, user-generated, scraped data, APIs, etc.]

**How many crowd workers do you need?**
[Estimate the scale: 10s, 100s, 1000s?]

## Technical Approach

**What are the main steps/components in your system?**

1. [Step 1: e.g., "User uploads image"]
2. [Step 2: e.g., "System segments image into regions"]
3. [Step 3: e.g., "Crowd labels each region"]
4. [Step 4: e.g., "System aggregates labels via majority vote"]
5. [Step 5: e.g., "ML model is trained on labeled data"]

**What parts are done by the crowd vs. automated?**
[Clearly distinguish human tasks from computational tasks]

**What technologies/tools will you use?**
[E.g., Python, React, AWS, specific ML libraries, MTurk API, etc.]

**How will you aggregate results from the crowd?**
[E.g., majority voting, weighted averaging, expert adjudication, ML filtering, etc.]

## Quality Control

**How will you ensure quality of crowd contributions?**

[Describe your quality control mechanisms in detail]

**Specific quality control methods:**
- [ ] Gold standard questions (test questions with known answers)
- [ ] Majority voting across multiple workers
- [ ] Expert review or verification
- [ ] Attention checks or trap questions
- [ ] Reputation/qualification systems
- [ ] Statistical outlier detection
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## Evaluation & Success Metrics

**How will you know if your project succeeds?**
[Describe specific metrics or evaluation criteria]

**What would success look like quantitatively?**
[E.g., "90% accuracy," "100 users in first week," "$X cost per task"]

## Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

_For each challenge, propose a mitigation strategy:_

**Challenge 1:** [Describe challenge]
**Mitigation:** [How will you address it?]

**Challenge 2:** [Describe challenge]
**Mitigation:** [How will you address it?]

**Challenge 3:** [Describe challenge]
**Mitigation:** [How will you address it?]
