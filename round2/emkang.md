## Authors

## Problem Statement
Many early-stage founders struggle to validate whether their startup ideas solve real customer problems before investing significant time or money. Existing validation processes (surveys, focus groups, or expert feedback) are often expensive, biased, or too small-scale. This project aims to crowdsource diverse, honest feedback from potential users and peers to help founders quickly gauge real-world interest.


## Target Audience
Early-stage startup founders, entrepreneurship students, incubators, and accelerators seeking fast, unbiased market validation.


## Description


PitchPeer is a crowdsourced platform where founders submit short startup pitches, and a global community provides feedback, votes, and conducts quick user interviews to validate ideas. Founders gain insight into their market potential and product clarity, while participants, such as students, enthusiasts, and professionals, gain early access to innovative ideas, networking opportunities, and potential internships or investments.
By combining crowdsourced validation, early crowdfunding access, and a community-driven job portal, PitchPeer connects early-stage founders with the crowd in a mutually beneficial ecosystem that supports learning, collaboration, and growth.


## Project Type


_Select the category that best fits your project:_


- [ ] Human computation algorithm
- [ ] Social science experiment with the crowd
- [X] Tool for crowdsourcing (requesters or workers)
- [ ] Business idea using crowdsourcing
- [ ] Other: [specify]


## Key Features


_List 5-8 key features or capabilities of your system. Expand from Round 1:_


1. Founder submission portal for 2-minute startup pitches.
2. Feedback interface with guided questions and upvote/downvote mechanisms.
3. Optional matching system for short video interviews between founders and interested crowd reviewers.
4. Routine updates on startup news for students
5. Priority internship and job portal
6. Early access crowdfunding platform
7. Office hours for founders for networking and learning


## Feasibility: Crowd & Resources


**Where will your crowd workers come from?**
Volunteers, startup enthusiasts, students, and entrepreneurship community members recruited via social media, online startup forums (e.g., Indie Hackers, Reddit r/startups), and university entrepreneurship programs.


**What will they provide?**
Written feedback on startup pitches, votes on perceived interest and clarity, optional participation in short user interviews, product use data and user experience insights


**What skills do they need?**
Critical thinking, communication, and an interest in entrepreneurship or user experience.


**Do skills vary widely? How?**
Certain workers may be more reliable and detailed in their feedback, and specific workers may be within the user group, making their feedback more valuable.


**How will you incentivize participation?**
Access to startup job/internship postings, early access to crowdfunding opportunities, community reputation points and leaderboard recognition, founders’ motivation: fast, affordable, real-world feedback


**How much will it cost?**
The platform can operate using low-cost or free tools (Google Forms, Airtable, Notion, Calendly, Zoom) with a budget under $500 for incentives, small-scale ad promotion, and domain hosting.


**Where will your data come from?**
User-submitted startup pitches and crowd-generated feedback collected through forms or a lightweight web app.


**How many crowd workers do you need?**
A few hundred participants (200–500) to ensure diverse, statistically meaningful feedback.


## Technical Approach


**What are the main steps/components in your system?**


1. Founder uploads pitch (video or written summary).
2. System posts pitch to public queue for crowd review.
3. Crowd participants rate clarity, interest, and feasibility; provide qualitative feedback.
4. System aggregates ratings and summarizes open feedback using NLP techniques.
5. Top-rated pitches are featured for optional interviews or crowdfunding opportunities.


**What parts are done by the crowd vs. automated?**
Crowd tasks are reviewing pitches, rating clarity/interest, writing short feedback, volunteering for interviews. Automated tasks are aggregating ratings, summarizing common feedback themes, managing reputation points, and scheduling optional meetings/interviews via automation tools.


**What technologies/tools will you use?**
We will use React for frontend, Firebase or Airtable for backend, Zapier, Calendly, or Google Scripts for automation, OpenAI API for NLP summarization, and GitHub Pages or Netlify for hosting.


**How will you aggregate results from the crowd?**
Weighted averaging of crowd ratings, NLP-based clustering of qualitative feedback, and reputation-weighted voting to prioritize reliable contributors.


## Quality Control


**How will you ensure quality of crowd contributions?**


We will implement reputation and trust scoring for participants based on engagement and quality, use upvotes/flags to highlight high-quality feedback, periodically verify top-rated reviews with founder feedback, and include short attention checks in surveys to filter low-effort responses.


**Specific quality control methods:**
- [X ] Gold standard questions (test questions with known answers)
- [X] Majority voting across multiple workers
- [X] Expert review or verification
- [X] Attention checks or trap questions
- [X] Reputation/qualification systems
- [ ] Statistical outlier detection
- [ ] Other: [specify]


## Evaluation & Success Metrics


**How will you know if your project succeeds?**
Success will be measured by both engagement metrics and quality of feedback.


**What would success look like quantitatively?**
≥200 active participants within first month, ≥80% of founders reporting “useful” or “actionable” feedback, average feedback length ≥ 50 words per response, <10% low-effort (flagged) submissions, and 5–10 validated startups advancing to crowdfunding or MVP testing


## Challenges & Mitigation Strategies


_For each challenge, propose a mitigation strategy:_


**Challenge 1:** Low-quality or spam feedback
**Mitigation:** Introduce reputation scores, flagging, and minimum word limits. Reward top contributors.


**Challenge 2:** Difficulty attracting initial crowd participation
**Mitigation:** Partner with university entrepreneurship clubs and incubators; use incentives like resume boosts, access to job boards, or certificates.


**Challenge 3:** Maintaining engagement over time
**Mitigation:** Regularly feature “Pitch of the Week,” community leaderboards, and occasional feedback contests with small prizes.


## Prior Work


_Are there similar projects or systems? How is yours different?_


Product Hunt is a crowdsourced product discovery site. It focuses on launched products, not early validation. PitchPeer fills the pre-launch gap. Reddit r/startups provides informal advice but lacks structure and aggregation. PitchPeer offers guided feedback and summary analytics. Kickstarter: Focuses on crowdfunding, not idea validation. PitchPeer bridges validation and funding stages.


## Discussion Notes from Round 2


**What did you agree on?**
We agreed on the focus on structured feedback over open-ended discussion, keeping the platform lightweight using existing free tools, and expanding the community to include students and job seekers for broader engagement.


**What concerns or pushback emerged?**
Concerns were balancing quality with openness to all contributors and ensuring meaningful incentives beyond intrinsic motivation.


**Why is this idea promising?**
It directly addresses a real pain point in startup development—early validation—using accessible, scalable crowdsourcing. It benefits all parties: founders gain insights, and contributors gain exposure, experience, and opportunity. We decided on this idea because of the urgent and apparent demand.


**What makes this sustainable and feasible?**
It leverages existing, low-cost platforms, a motivated target audience, and a self-reinforcing ecosystem as feedback leads to recognition which leads to opportunity. The modular structure allows small-scale piloting and rapid iteration.


## Additional Notes

Ideas include potential long-term integrations with platforms like Notion or Airtable for automatic portfolio creation, extension into a startup “sandbox” for students to co-develop MVPs, and gamified elements could later evolve into certifications or mentorship credits.
