## Problem Statement

Many early-stage founders struggle to validate whether their startup ideas solve real customer problems before investing significant time or money. Existing validation processes (surveys, focus groups, or expert feedback) are often expensive, biased, or too small-scale. This project aims to crowdsource diverse, honest feedback from potential users and peers to help founders quickly gauge real-world interest.

## Target Audience

**End Users:** Early-stage founders, student entrepreneurs, and innovators seeking feedback on their startup ideas.

**Crowd Workers:** Other entrepreneurs, business students, professionals, and users interested in startups or feedback-based gamification.

**Stakeholders:** University entrepreneurship programs, accelerators, and potential investors who benefit from better-prepared founders.


## Description

PitchPeer is a web-based platform where users upload short startup pitches (text or video) and receive structured, crowdsourced feedback from peers. The platform leverages crowdsourcing principles to gather diverse perspectives on each idea’s clarity, market fit, and innovation potential. Crowd workers earn reputation points and badges for providing detailed, constructive evaluations, encouraging engagement and trust.

The system uses a gamified model, users can both submit pitches and review others’ pitches, fostering a reciprocal ecosystem of feedback. A quality control algorithm filters low-effort responses and highlights insightful ones. Over time, PitchPeer becomes a database of startup learning and feedback trends, providing value beyond individual sessions.

## Feasibility: Crowd & Resources

**Where will your crowd workers come from?**
Primarily from university entrepreneurship communities, LinkedIn startup groups, online startup forums (e.g., Indie Hackers, Product Hunt), and through gamified recruitment on social media.

**What will they provide?**
Crowd workers will provide qualitative feedback and structured ratings (1–5 scale) on idea clarity, feasibility, and potential impact. They can also add open-ended comments.

**What skills do they need?**
Basic business or problem-solving intuition, communication skills, and an understanding of feedback quality.

**Do skills vary widely? How?**
Yes. Founders and business students bring different perspectives. PitchPeer accounts for this by weighting responses from higher-reputation users more heavily in the aggregate score.

**How will you incentivize participation?**
Gamified incentives (points, badges, leaderboards), reputation-based privileges (e.g., ability to post more pitches), and social recognition (top reviewer highlights). Extrinsic incentives include potential networking and exposure opportunities.


**Budget & Cost Analysis:**
- Estimated cost per task: [$0.05–$0.10/task]
- Estimated cost per worker: [$1/worker]
- Number of tasks needed: [5000]
- Total estimated budget: [$250/total]
- Justification: Focused primarily on organic participation and gamification rather than large-scale paid crowdsourcing.

**Where will your data come from?**
User-submitted pitch content and feedback generated on the platform. Optionally, integration with existing open startup databases for benchmarking.

**Scale Requirements:**
- Minimum viable crowd size: [100 workers]
- Target crowd size for full functionality: [1000 workers]
- Potential to scale to: [10000+ workers]

2.	System assigns the pitch to multiple reviewers with matched experience levels.
3.	Reviewers provide structured feedback and ratings.
4.	Quality control filters low-effort or biased feedback.
5.	System aggregates scores and highlights key insights.
6.	Feedback is shared with the original user via dashboard.
7.	Reviewers earn points, badges, and higher reputation scores.

**Human vs. Automated Tasks:**

| Task | Performed By | Why? |
|------|--------------|------|
| [Providing feedback
] | Human | [Requires subjective evaluation and creativity] |
| [Aggregating feedback
] | Automated | [Ensures consistency and scalability
] |
| [Quality filtering
] | Automated | [Uses NLP to detect low-quality or duplicate responses
] |
| [Reviewer ranking
] | Automated | [Calculated based on feedback quality metrics
] |

**Technologies & Tools:**
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ML/AI: scikit-learn, OpenAI API
- Crowdsourcing Platform: Custom web app
- Hosting: AWS or Vercel
- Other: Framer Motion (UI animations), Airtable API (optional for data tracking)

**Aggregation Method:**
Weighted averaging combining multiple feedback dimensions, with reviewer reputation scores influencing the final aggregate. NLP is used to detect redundancy or sentiment bias in textual feedback.

## Quality Control

**Quality Control Strategy:**
Hybrid quality control using redundancy, reputation weighting, and AI-assisted moderation ensures that only meaningful, detailed feedback is highlighted.

**Specific QC Mechanisms:**
- [] Gold standard questions (test questions with known answers)
  - _Details: [How many? How distributed? What happens if workers fail?]_
- [X] Majority voting across multiple workers
  - _Details: [At least 3 reviewers per pitch; consensus scores drive aggregate results.]_
- [X] Expert review or verification
  - _Details: [10% of submissions reviewed by experienced entrepreneurs.]_
- [X] Attention checks or trap questions
  - _Details: [Random prompts requiring specific keywords to ensure engagement.]_
- [X] Reputation/qualification systems
  - _Details: [Reviewers gain reputation through consistent, detailed contributions.]_
- [X] Statistical outlier detection
  - _Details: [Feedback significantly deviating from norms flagged for review.]_
- [ ] Redundancy and agreement metrics
  - _Details: [How much redundancy? What agreement threshold?]_
- [ ] Other: [specify]
  - _Details: [Explain custom QC approaches]_

**Handling Low-Quality Work:**
Low-effort feedback is filtered out and replaced. Repeat offenders lose reputation points and visibility on leaderboards.

## Evaluation & Success Metrics

**Primary Success Metrics:**

	1.	Average feedback quality rating: ≥ 4.0/5 (user satisfaction)
	2.	Reviewer retention rate: ≥ 60% after 2 sessions
	3.	Average turnaround time for feedback: ≤ 48 hours

**Evaluation Methodology:**

Surveys of users (founders) and analysis of feedback engagement metrics. Pilot testing on a small cohort (100–200 users) to measure quality and consistency before scaling.

**Baseline Comparisons:**
Compared against unstructured feedback (e.g., Reddit or online forums) in terms of relevance, constructiveness, and usability.

**Success Criteria:**
- Minimum viable success: 50 active users, 200 feedbacks/week
- Target success: 500 users, high feedback satisfaction (≥ 4/5)
- Stretch success: 2,000+ users and integration with a university accelerator program
