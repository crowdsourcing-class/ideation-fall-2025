# NETS 2130 — Project Ideation — Spring 2025

This repository is for collaborative ideation of crowdsourcing projects. All ideas generated here become available to the entire class for team formation.

## How to Use This Repository

### Phase 1: Review Past Projects (First 15 minutes)
Browse the `past-projects/` folder to see what previous students built. Look for:
- What worked well?
- What challenges did they face?
- What was a realistic scope?

### Phase 2: Progressive Ideation (75 minutes)
You'll develop ideas through three rounds of increasing collaboration:
- **Round 1:** Individual idea (20 minutes)
- **Round 2:** Paired refinement (25 minutes)  
- **Round 3:** Group synthesis (30 minutes)

### Submission Process
1. Fork this repository
2. Create your file in the appropriate round folder (`round1/`, `round2/`, `round3/`)
3. Name it `[pennkey].md` (e.g., `jsmith.md`)
4. Use the appropriate template for each round:
   - Round 1: `TEMPLATE-ROUND1.md`
   - Round 2: `TEMPLATE-ROUND2.md`
   - Round 3: `TEMPLATE-ROUND3.md`
5. Submit via pull request

### Important Notes
⚠️ **Replace all [bracketed text]** with your actual content  
⚠️ **Remove the brackets** - they're just placeholders  
⚠️ **Steel-man rule:** Build up ideas to their strongest version, don't tear them down

## The Three Rounds

### Round 1 (Individual) - 35 minutes total
- Review past projects (15 min)
- Generate initial idea (15 min)
- Write initial idea using `TEMPLATE-ROUND1.md` (5 min)
   - All other rounds will be combining on one of these proposals
   - This is the only time you will get to focus on writing clearly

### Round 2 (Pairs) - 25 minutes
- Present ideas to each other (10 min total, 5 min each)
- Choose one idea to expand (2 min)
- Develop the chosen idea together using `TEMPLATE-ROUND2.md` (8 min)
- Submit expanded version (5 min)

### Round 3 (Groups of 4) - 30 minutes
- Present both ideas (10 min total, 5 min each)
- Steel-man both ideas - make them as strong as possible (10 min)
- Choose most promising idea (2 min)
- Final development using `TEMPLATE-ROUND3.md` and submission (8 min)

## After This Session
- All ideas become available to the entire class
- Teams form next week and can adopt any idea (or propose new ones)
- Original creators aren't obligated to work on their submitted ideas
- Think of this as building a "commons" of well-developed concepts

## Questions to Keep in Mind
- Where will your crowd come from?
- What specific tasks will they perform?
- How will you ensure quality without breaking the bank?
- How will you aggregate noisy crowd data?
- What would a working demo look like?

## The Steel-Man Rule
When discussing ideas, your job is to make every idea as strong as possible. Ask "How could this work?" not "Why won't this work?"

## Ground Rules
- Budget constraint: Assume < $500 total
- Team size: 4-6 students, one semester
- Must meaningfully use crowdsourcing
- Must include quality control mechanisms
- Must have an aggregation strategy
