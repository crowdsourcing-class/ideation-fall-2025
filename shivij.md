## Problem Statement
This will be a crowdsourced travel guide where people can both document their vacations as well as help point out their highlights on the trip. Right now, travel planning is hard, where people look at places like tripadvisor and travel websites, but it always jsut has the most popular destinations that are sometimes overly crowded and dont give visitors the real experience. 

## Core Concept
**One-line pitch:** A social, crowdsourced travel companion that helps users discover authentic, lesser-known destinations through real traveler experiences.

**Target users:** Travel enthusiasts, college students studying abroad, and people planning vacations who want genuine local insights instead of commercialized recommendations

**The crowd:** Everyday travelers and locals who contribute reviews, short videos, and itineraries from their own trips — similar to social media micro-influencers or volunteer contributors.
**The task:** [What EXACTLY will crowd workers do? Be specific.]
Crowd workers will upload trip highlights (e.g., “best café near Kyoto station,” “hidden beach in Positano”), share photos or short write-ups, tag locations, and upvote or comment on others’ posts to refine quality and relevance. They will rank all of the place they went with pictures and moments for users to follow. In addition certain spots can be upvoted. 

## Key Features
1. Geo-tagged Experience Feed
2. Community-curated Itineraries
3. A scrapbook of your own memories for future use

## Feasibility Check
**Data source:** User-generated submissions and public tourism APIs for location metadata

**Budget reality:** Using student credits and open source software like Firebase, Supabase, or Google Maps API free tier

**Crowd size needed:** 100s of users (but depends on the range of locations)

**Quality control approach:** Upvote/downvote systems, reputation scores for frequent contributors, and moderator review for flagged posts or duplicate content.

## Technical Approach
**Human tasks:** Submitting posts, tagging locations, rating and reviewing destinations, and writing short summaries of experiences.

**Automated tasks:** [Clustering similar destinations, ranking top posts by quality/reputation, coming up with custom iteneraries for users

**Aggregation method:** Weighted ranking that combines user upvotes, contributor reputation, and engagement metrics

## Prior Work
**Similar projects:** [Name 1-2 related projects and how yours differs]
Trip advisor

**Lessons from past course projects:** [What did you learn from reviewing past projects?]

## Why This Could Work
[2-3 sentences on why this is viable within course constraints]
